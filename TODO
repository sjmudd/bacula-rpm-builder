TODO LIST
=========

The build still does not work in a general way and the following issues
need to be resolved:

- allow the build to use the OS based MySQL (rather than my preference of MySQL community 8.0)
- make build work with	--define 'build_postgresql 1'
- make build work on CentOS 7 and CentOS 9, ideally by recognising the base OS and not requiring any manual configuration.
- make the build use the latest gcc-toolset version usable on each release
- make the determination of the version to build configurable, e.g. by tag name.
  - for now we provide GIT_TAG=13.0.1, yet the tag in git is actually Release-13.0.1
- add build of the other .spec file related packages
- make the following rpm build settings optionally configurable
  - Packager    : 'Bacula Systems SA <packagers@baculasystems.com>'
  - Vendor      : The Bacula Team
- make the docker hostname match the OS
